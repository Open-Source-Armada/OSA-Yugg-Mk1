# OSA-Yugg-Mk1
A 4 gun meta fighter designed to be my ideal cheap assault ship. My newest design prototype. Comes in autocannon, laser and plasma variants.


//Specs//


4 mounted weapons with a staggered fire trigger system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Rapidfire button switches between staggered fire (gun 2 will stagger behind gun 1 creating a machine gun effect) and alpha strike (both guns fire together).

BoostMin and BoostMax act as a aim keybind without yolo (yolo is avoided where possible due to the 0.2 delay) these should ALWAYS be bound to the same key.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

This can be altered to be the more common method of aiming, having higher sense as standard, and having the ships pitch/yaw slow down for aiming.
(Swap the BoostMin/BoostMax Off values with its On values, remember to set it in the pitch/yaw lever fields too)

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Its primarlily plated using char across the front face of the ship, alloys are on the side/rear armour..

145 m/s max speed using T2 thrusters.

1485110.12 kg in weight.

Two small prop tanks for 2 million prop, 50 mins estimated flight time.

2 T1 fuel chamber, 6 T1 generators, 6 T1 enhancers.

Uses basic FCU, no reverse, roll is performed using Roll_L and Roll_R buttons, this is to allow fast handling by isolating the roll thrusters from the FCU/MFC.

//Tactics//


The Yugg was made to fill a need for a meta tanked light fighter that could still be mass built easily while providing enough guns and armour go head to head with the best.

It takes heavy insparation from Pandora's Box, and there dangerous 4/8/12 gun fighter lineup, which has shown to be a fantastic ship setup.

Almost all of the frontal armour is char, making this an aggresive front line brawler.

While this ship is a a orbit dogfighter, it is small enough to be used in gravity, making it perfect for escorting VIP's.

Like all my ships, care has been taken to ensure the silhouette is as symetrical as possible, so as to reduce skilled pilots ability to isolate weakpoints (Like the cockpit)

Its also recomended to adjust your angle of attack when orbiting, to sprerad damage accross different plates, reducing the chance of a busted plate or a pen shot.

This can be done by rolling the ship, or by turning opposite to the orbit and transitioning into a joust.

4 guns are a minimum for dealing with competent meta fighters.

Best employed as a moon gate escort ship, a station/cap ship defence fighter, or as an intro meta fighter for newer combat pilots taking a more leading role in frontling dogfighting.

It is also the middle ground of weapons value, autocannon, laser and plasma versions have near continuous firing guns, making all 3 excellent investments.

This ship is made to compromise as little as possible in the method or armouring i know.

Armour is front facing to survive orbit fights, this ship should have a great advantage against other ships of its class, can tank larger ships as well.

Side, top, bottom and thruster plates are made of the largest possible, to increase the "Magic Health" of the plates.

Large triangle plates are used as much as possible due to them having great performance againts all mounted weapons, pound for pound best all round plate.

Front of the ship is composed of stacked large plates, made of char, that surround the guns and is the core armour located at the front.

As well as having high magic health, the direction the plates are stacked to take advantage of the voxel damage system.

When a plates health is broken, it will begin taking voxel damage, by stacking the plates lenghtways you ensure the projectile must pass through as much material as possible.

Plates (even small plates) can resist multiple rounds on top of there magic health, if the plate is broken but still on the ship, it wil continue to provide some protection.

This method is best against lasers, as magic health is quickly destroyed by laser weapons and above.

It is also segmented, meaning that that the damage will be spread accross mutiple plates instaed of one, reducing the chance of well aimed burst penertrating your armour.

Surrounding this voxel armour are more large triangles, to cover up the angles the voxel plates will not apply it effects.

Along the very prow of the ship are bastonium railings, this is sacrifice plating to assorb damage from plasma/railguns.

Unlike lasers, plasma and railguns excell at breaking large plate health AND voxel armour, while lacking crit chance on explosive components.

Without sacrifice plating, it is only a matter of time before you armour is gone and your ship is rendered unflyable.

Where plasma/rails do not do well against is ironicaly, small plates, as the shatter damage dealt struggles to spread from plate to plate.

This means using smaller plates on the outer layer is in fact a great technique, and can protect your core armour from deadly alpha strikes with late game weapons.

These plates still help with lower tier weapon fire.

This ship has autocannon, laser and plasma versions, i consider higher tier weapons to hold less value on smaller ships vs big, so use to your taste.

This ship is not max speed as it would require a massive nerf to the voxel armour, leaving the ship vulnrable to lasers, i encourage expirementing with the plate mats.
